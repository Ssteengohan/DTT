## Project Recap - Feedback from Colleagues

In this video recap, I will be discussing the feedback I received from two colleagues after showcasing my project. The project is a CRUD system built on Vue.js, HTML, and CSS. The objective assigned by my employer was to create a Funda-like website for DTT.

During the project demonstration, my colleagues provided valuable feedback, highlighting both positive aspects and suggestions for improvement. Here's a summary of their feedback:

1. **Positive Feedback**:
   - They mentioned that the project looked neat and well-designed, which is an encouraging remark.

2. **Suggested Enhancements**:
   - Inclusion of an **authentication/login system**: They suggested adding a login feature to enhance user security and provide personalized experiences.
   - Implementation of a **favorite system per customer**: They recommended adding functionality for users to mark properties as favorites and easily access them in the future.
   - Sending **update emails** when a favorited property undergoes any changes: They proposed implementing an automated email notification system to inform users when any of their favorite properties are updated.

 I plan to incorporate these enhancements into my project. However, I would like to clarify that I will incorporate this feedback after submitting the project to DTT and receiving their approval. It is essential to ensure that the project aligns with DTT's requirements and meets their expectations before integrating any additional features or modifications.

Once DTT has reviewed and approved the project, I will proceed with integrating the suggested enhancements. This approach ensures that the project maintains its integrity and remains aligned with the initial objectives set by my employer.

I value the feedback provided by my colleagues and recognize the potential value these suggestions can bring to the project. By waiting for DTT's approval, I can guarantee that the final implementation reflects both the project requirements and the additional improvements suggested by my colleagues.

Thank you for understanding this approach, and I look forward to implementing the feedback once the project has been reviewed and approved by DTT.
