# Test report
## Report:
***
For my VueJS project, I ran a test to test the functionality of the "learn more about the company" (About) page. The test focused on checking whether the user stories were supported, namely that users are able to see the company logo, company description and company website.

During the test I took the following steps:

1. Opened the "more information about the company"(About) page and checked the company logo was displayed correctly.

### Give example what is good and wrong 

2. Checked whether the company description was displayed correctly.
    
3. Checked that the company website was displayed correctly and that the link to the website works.
    

## Conclusions:
***
The test shows that the "more information about the company" (About) page meets the user stories below. The company logo was displayed correctly, duplicate the company description and company website. The link to the website also worked as expected. This means that users are able to get more information about the company and easily access the company website.
