### Reflection Meeting

During the reflection meeting, I received valuable feedback on my code and had productive discussions. Here are the key points discussed:

1. **CSS Improvements**: My colleague pointed out that there is room for improvement in my CSS code, suggesting that it could be made more concise and efficient. I appreciate this feedback and will work on optimizing and streamlining my styling code to create a more compact and maintainable CSS file.

2. **Eliminating Manual Refresh**: It was highlighted that the user experience could be enhanced by eliminating the need for manual refreshing after creating or editing a house. To address this, I will implement an automatic refresh functionality using techniques like `window.location.reload()`. This will ensure that any changes made to houses are immediately visible to the user without requiring manual intervention.

3. **Naming Conventions**: It was advised that I could enhance the readability and maintainability of my code by using more descriptive names for classes and divs. I acknowledge the importance of clear naming conventions and will revise and improve the names throughout the project. By doing so, it will be easier for myself and other developers to understand the purpose and functionality of each element.

Overall, the meeting went well, and there was a sense of enthusiasm about the project. I appreciate the feedback and constructive discussions, as they provide valuable insights for improving the codebase and enhancing the user experience.
